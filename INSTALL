Installation 

0. The following must have been installed in advance.

  * Ruby, of course <http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/download.html>.

  * NArray: a multi-dimensional numeric array class for Ruby. 
    <http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/raa-list.rhtml?name=NArray>


  * NetCDF ver 3. <http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/>
    (Fortran and C++ interfaces are not needed, so you
    can ignore it if their installation does not succeed.)

  * (OPTIONAL) NArrayMiss, which is require to use
    NetCDFVar#get_with_miss etc by 

      require 'numru/netcdf_miss'
 
    NArrayMiss does not have to be installed in advance.

1. Change to the top directory such as by:

      % cd ruby-netcdf-0.5.3

    Here, "%" is a "prompt". Do not type it.
    The directory name depends on the version of RubyNetCDF

2. Configure your setting to create Makefile.

      % ruby extconf.rb           

    NOTE: By default, the two headers narray.h and narray_config.h
    in the narraypackage are assumed to have been copied to
    $(sitearchdir), which is normally 
    /usr/local/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.6/$(arch)/ if you are using Unix,
    where $(arch) is something like sparc-solaris2.6, a combination of
    CPU and OS. To specify the directory that contains these files
    explicitly, use instead the following:

      % ruby extconf.rb --with-narray-include=/narraydir/include

    Similarly, you can specify the directory you installed netcdf
    with the following:

      % ruby extconf.rb --with-netcdf-include=/netcdfdir/include \
                        --with-netcdf-include=/netcdfdir/lib
    or 

      % ruby extconf.rb --with-netcdf-dir=/netcdfdir

3. Compile source codes and create a shared library.

      % make                      

4. Optionally, you can run a test program by the following:

      % make test

5. Installs it into your site-specific library path for Ruby.

      % make site-install
