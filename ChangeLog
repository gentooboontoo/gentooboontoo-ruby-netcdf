Mon Apr 11 2005  Takeshi Horinouchi 
	* netcdfraw.c: changed global variables such as mNumRu to file locale.
Tue Mar 15 2005  Takeshi Horinouchi 
	* netcdfraw.c: debug: changed the type of c_stride from size_t to
	  ptrdiff_t. Removed unsuned variables.
Mon Mar 14 2005  Takeshi Horinouchi 
	* ruby-netcdf-0.6.0 released
	* netcdfraw.c: NetCDF_get_var*_*: debug for rank-zero scalar
	  NetCDFVar. It used to SEGV.
	  NetCDF_get_var_*, which reads the whole variable,
 	  is modified to return in a NArray of shape==[1].
	  On the other hand, subset reading by NetCDF_get_var[s1]_*
	  is prohibited for rank-zero scalars by raising an exception.
	* lib/netcdf.rb: minor modification in [], to support its call
	  without arguments of a rank-zero scalar.
	* netcdfraw.c: debug: changed size_t to int when NArray functions
	  are called (for 64-bit machines).
	* extconf.rb: minor change in opendap configuration.
Thu Mar 10 2005  Takeshi Horinouchi 
	* extconf.rb: to link OPeNDAP/DODS-enabled version of NetCDF
	  if available and if --disable-opendap is not specified.
	* lib/netcdf.rb: created pack and unpack by separating from
	  scaled_put and scaled_get, respectvely. Changed type to
	  unpack in to follow the coerce mechanism, so the upacked
	  type depend on the type of scale_factor and add_offset.
          Renamed NetCDFVar.scaled_get_type[=] to NetCDFVar.unpack_type[=].
        * lib/netcdf_miss.rb: revised [put|get]_with_miss_and_scaling:
	  Now, missing data handling using valid_* / missing_value is applied 
          basically to packed data, which is consistent with most
          conventions. However, it is applied to unpacked data 
          if and only if the type of valid_* / missing_value is not the same as
          the packed data and is the samed as the unpacked data.
        * doc/ Updated in response to the modification.

	* Verified that all test programs work fine with Ruby 1.8.0.

	  if not found (by name), as opposed to the change on Feb 3 2003.
	  Debug NetCDF_att_rename (NetCDFAtt#name=).
	  Init_netcdfraw: No longer asks whether NumRu has been
	  defined -- ok for Ruby 1.6.5 or so or later
	* doc/Ref_man.rd,doc/Ref_man_jp.rd: updated for the changes above
	* test/test.rb updated for the debug of NetCDFAtt#name=.
	* lib/netcdf.rb: editted NetCDF#vars and NetCDF#dims not to change
	  the behavior despite the change above. Corrected exception types
	  to raise where needed.
Tue Aug 19 2003  Takeshi Horinouchi
	* demo/demo4-copy.rb: created
Tue Aug 12 2003  Takeshi Horinouchi

Mon Aug 11 2003  Takeshi Horinouchi
	* extconf.rb: modification to cover Cygwin
	* netcdfraw.c: extern -> EXTERN
	* lib/netcdf.rb: renamed get|put as simple_(get|put) and
	  made get|put aliased to them. Changed scaled_(get|put)
 	  to depend on simple_(put|get). This is to allow the user
	  to redefine get|put, if he/she likes, as:
	     alias get scaled_get
	     alias put scaled_put
	  Or (by using singleton methods)
	     def a_ncvar.get(*arg)
	       scaled_get(*arg)
	     end
	     def a_ncvar.put(*arg)
	       scaled_put(*arg)
	     end
	  Now these do not cause recurrence. By doing so, one can 
	  also change the behavior of [] and []=.

	  nil if not (the latter means that the file is already in
	  define mode for redef and that it is already in the data mode
	  for enddef). Previously, these methods always retuned nil.
